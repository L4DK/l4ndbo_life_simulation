# üìñ PROJECT Description
Presenting: The "Life Simulation by ![alt text](https://l4ndbo.com/media/brand/l4/logo/l4-logo_16x14.svg)"
A Life Simulation system coded by me Michael, for the fun of it. 
+ Using a lot of development time, planning, swearing, crying, screaming, and everything that a man with a plan encounters.
+ Designing the codebase for smooth operations,
+ natively supporting all future code implementations, and code/lib upgrades that enable scaling of the project without rewriting everything. 
+ A hell lot of classes, functions, cheat code (ssssh..) to control every aspect of the sim and the autonomous, AI-driven agents in partnership with other autonomous agents, this simulation explores the evolution of life by exploring each agent's interactions with one another.  

As the simulation features various types of atoms, each with unique properties and behaviors, the simulation allows for intricate and dynamic interactions between the atoms and the surrounding environment. 
It is the goal of this project to provide users with an engaging, fun, and scientifically intriguing experience that will facilitate their learning of the mechanics of life itself in a fun and exciting way. 
The project encompasses the dynamic simulation of life-like behaviors and interactions among autonomous AI agents. 
It serves as a visual and interactive representation of atoms' evolution and interactions within a controlled environment. 
The simulation integrates various features, including AI-driven behaviors, mutation and evolution, collision detection, gravity, and physics, as well as user interaction through zooming, panning, and time control.
